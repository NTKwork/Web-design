            <p>When you have been hit by the spending bug, it's hard to turn things around. All you want to do is
               buy yourself something nice, right? Shopping can trigger pleasure centres in the brain and thus is
               a hard habit to break out of. Here's how to make your brain understand that you need to save, not spend.

            <img class="article_image" src="img/sky.jpg" alt="Napping - The Good">
            <p>As we've covered here before, daytime napping can be disruptive to sleep patterns. Which can in turn
               be disruptive to your health in general. However, a great many people swear by napping. Both Edison
               and Einstein liked a quick snooze in between bursts of scientific brilliance. Winston Churchill did
               not let even the pressures of wartime governance prevent him from taking his afternoon nap. Napoleon
               Bonaparte was a prolific napper, as were Presidents ...

            <h3>Is Depression Really On The Rise? If So, Why?</h3>
            <img class="article_image" src="img/sea.jpg" alt="Depression">
            <p>If you look at depression statistics spread over several years, a very worrying trend becomes immediately
               apparent. Cases of depression begin to rise extremely sharply in around 2005, and continue to escalate at
               an alarming pace. Should the problem continue in this vein, it seems that everyone in the world will before
                long be suffering from depression, or some form of anxiety disorder. Not good. Science and psychiatry are,
                it seems, a little divided on the issue. Various theories as to the source of the problem ...
